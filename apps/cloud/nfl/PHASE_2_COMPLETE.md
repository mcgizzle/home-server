# Phase 2: Extract Repositories & External Services - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Phase 2 has been successfully completed. We extracted database operations into repository interfaces and ESPN API operations into external service clients, establishing proper dependency injection and clean architecture patterns.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Repository Layer Extraction
- **Created `internal/repository/result_repository.go`**: 
  - Defined `ResultRepository` interface with methods:
    - `SaveResults(results []domain.Result) error`
    - `LoadResults(season, week, seasonType string) ([]domain.Result, error)`
    - `LoadDates() ([]domain.Date, error)`
  - Implemented `SQLiteResultRepository` with full SQLite database operations
  - Proper error handling and logging throughout

### 2. External Service Layer Extraction
- **Created `internal/external/espn_client.go`**:
  - Defined `ESPNClient` interface with methods:
    - `ListLatestEvents() (LatestEvents, error)`
    - `ListSpecificEvents(season, week, seasonType string) (SpecificEvents, error)`
    - `GetEvent(ref string) (EventResponse, error)`
    - `GetEventById(id string) (EventResponse, error)`
    - `GetScore(ref string) (ScoreResponse, error)`
    - `GetTeam(ref string) (TeamResponse, error)`
    - `GetRecord(ref string) (RecordResponse, error)`
    - `GetDetails(ref string, page int) (DetailsResponse, error)`
    - `GetDetailsPaged(ref string) ([]DetailsResponse, error)`
    - `GetTeamAndScore(response EventResponse) *domain.Game`
  - Implemented `HTTPESPNClient` with full HTTP operations
  - Proper error handling and response parsing

### 3. Dependency Injection Implementation
- **Updated `main.go`**:
  - Removed all direct database and HTTP operations
  - Added dependency injection in `main()` function
  - Updated all functions to accept repository and ESPN client interfaces
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
  - Proper error handling throughout the application

### 4. Test Suite Updates
- **Updated `main_test.go`**:
  - Created comprehensive mock implementations for both interfaces
  - Added mock OpenAI server to prevent real API calls during testing
  - Updated all tests to use dependency injection
  - Maintained test coverage and functionality
  - All core tests passing

### 5. Code Cleanup
- **Removed old functions**:
  - `listLatestEvents()`, `listSpecificEvents()`, `getEvent()`, etc.
  - `saveResults()`, `loadResults()`, `loadDates()`
  - All direct database and HTTP operations
- **Maintained backward compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Database operations** isolated in repository layer
- **External API calls** isolated in external service layer
- **Business logic** remains in domain layer
- **HTTP handlers** focus only on request/response handling

### 2. Testability
- **Mock implementations** for both repository and ESPN client
- **Dependency injection** enables easy unit testing
- **Isolated testing** of each layer independently
- **No real API calls** during testing

### 3. Maintainability
- **Interface-based design** enables easy swapping of implementations
- **Clear boundaries** between layers
- **Consistent error handling** throughout
- **Reduced coupling** between components

### 4. Extensibility
- **Easy to add new data sources** by implementing repository interface
- **Easy to add new external services** by implementing client interfaces
- **Easy to add new storage backends** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- **Easy to add new API providers** (different sports APIs, etc.)

## Test Results
```
=== RUN   TestFetchResultsForThisWeek
--- PASS: TestFetchResultsForThisWeek (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestFetchResults
--- PASS: TestFetchResults (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestHTTPBoundaries
--- PASS: TestHTTPBoundaries (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestDatabaseOperations
--- PASS: TestDatabaseOperations (0.00s)
```

## Next Steps
Phase 2 establishes the foundation for clean architecture. The application now has:
- ✅ **Domain Layer**: Business entities and logic
- ✅ **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction
- ✅ **External Service Layer**: API client abstraction
- ✅ **Application Layer**: HTTP handlers with dependency injection

The system is now ready for Phase 3: Extract Use Cases & Application Services, which would introduce application services to orchestrate business logic between the domain, repository, and external service layers.

## Files Modified
- `main.go`: Updated to use dependency injection
- `main_test.go`: Updated to use mock implementations
- `internal/repository/result_repository.go`: New repository interface and implementation
- `internal/external/espn_client.go`: New ESPN client interface and implementation

## Files Removed
- All old direct database and HTTP functions from `main.go`

## Backward Compatibility
✅ **Maintained**: All existing functionality preserved
✅ **Database Schema**: Unchanged
✅ **API Endpoints**: Unchanged
✅ **Template Rendering**: Unchanged
✅ **Background Processing**: Unchanged
